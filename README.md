A repository containing some of the scripts used on my public Minecraft server, Silver Springs Survival. All scripts in this repository are written solely by me unless noted otherwise.

Silver Springs Survival is a public, semi-vanilla, non-profit, hard difficulty Minecraft survival server. I'm the owner and developer, and there are other staff who aid in player management and gameplay design & development.

Scripts are loaded onto the server and parsed using the plugin [Skript](https://github.com/bensku/Skript). Certain Skript addons are available to allow Skript code to access more Bukkit or plugin API's. Silver Springs Survival uses the following addons:
- MundoSK
- SharpSK
- skDragon
- Skellett
- SkMorkaz
- SkQuery
- skript-mirror
- SkStuff
- TuSKe
- WolvSK

Not all of these addons are used in all or any scripts in this repository, but all are currently installed on Silver Springs Survival. Scripts contain various custom features that are used by staff or all players. Not all scripts used on the server are listed here (some contain private information that should not be accessible to players by any means, including an open source repository). 

My work primarily involves the creation of API's for us to use when writing scripts, and gameplay programming of new mechanics for players to interact with. Unrelated to the scripting, I also act as a community manager for the server, which includes dealing with players, receiving and organizing feedback, leading staff discussions, working with plugin developers to resolve issues and develop new features, and plan/discuss/implement new server features and updates. I am a collaborator on the linked Skript repository, where I work to organize, troubleshoot, and resolve issue reports as to save time for the lead developer and expediate the plugin's development.
